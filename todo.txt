36. sitemap for dynamic pages:
Updating the sitemap every time you update your CMS will definitely create performance issues, because sitemaps tend to be large, and costly to generate (from a CPU & disk i/o perspective).

What I would do is:
1. map out the structure of your site
2. determine which areas you need to link to in the sitemap
3. add the name of the sitemap index to your robots.txt file
4. write a script that will read from the database and generate static xml sitemap files
5. create a cron job that will re-run this script on a regular basis
6. submit your sitemap url to the search engines
